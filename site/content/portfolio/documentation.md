As with any open source project, its documentation are crusiual for its users and fondamental for its contributors. This is also the case for a hardware project like the STRÃ˜M 1.0. Maybe even more so.

With this project we have decided to use [readthedocs](https://stroem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as our documentation platform. This type of platform provides os with additional flexibility and customization options, as we rely on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) framework which is highly customizable.

### What can you find within the documentation?

At least the following sections are inteded to be covered in the project documentation. Some are more complete than others, but they will all grow in content torwards to product release.

* Requirements
* User Documentation
* Repair
* End of life
* Speaker Parts and Assembly
* The Software Platform
* Contribution Guideline
* Project Licensing


### Contributor guide

We love contributors and the lovely contributions. So to make it easier to get involved we have a dedicated document describing just that. Here's a short snippet:


>  ### Create a Pull Request (PR)
>  All changes to the code base or the documentation are handled through pull requests. This means that any contribution that consists of a change to the code based must be submitted as a PR. Please also link your PR to an existing issue or create a new one if needed.
>  
>  Each PR will be reviewed by the code owner before it can merged.
Suggest a missing feature
>  
>  If you miss a specific feature or functionality, then create a new feature request issue, where you described the requested feature in detail.
>
