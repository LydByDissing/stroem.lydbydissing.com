heading : "The STRÃ˜M 1.0 project is an open source product development demonstrator facilitated as part of Lyd by Dissing"
description : "With this project it is not the goal to create another boombox, with over attenuated lows (bass) and highs (treble) as this will quickly result in listening fatigue. This is also called a smiley face curve. We have aimed at creating a well balanced speaker that does not induce listening fatigue."
